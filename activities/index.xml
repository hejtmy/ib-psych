      <description>This activity focuses on students ability to read and understand even complex articles. It&amp;rsquo;s goal isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily for the student to understand everything in the text, but to be able to pinpoint important parts and to discuss valid points the article makes.
The activity follows classes on research. Students are given each question immediately after appropriate lesson has been covered (e.g. question 10 after ethics have been gone through). In the end, students hand out a summary of a scientific paper.</description>

      <description>Personality profiles derived from star placements during the time of one&amp;rsquo;s birth are a thorn in a foot of many psychologists. But is there a reason?
One of the old principles say, that if a theory survives for a long time, there must be some validity in it. So how is it with zodiac signs?
This activity can be preceded by the Forer effect activity
 Goal Investigate validity of zodiac personality profiles.</description>
