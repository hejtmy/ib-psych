	"content": " The biological approach to behaviour looks at: • the brain and behaviour (SL and HL) • hormones and behaviour (SL and HL) • genetics and behaviour (SL and HL) • the role of animal research in understanding human behavior (HL only).\nThe brain and behaviour  Techniques used to study the brain in relation to behaviour: The choice of techniques used to correlate the brain with behaviour is based on a variety of factors including opportunity, available technology and costs. An awareness of these limitations as well as the strengths of these different techniques is important when evaluating the contribution they have made to understanding behaviour.\n Methods used to study the brain: fMRI, MRI, EEG, CAT, PET are the most frequent techniques used to investigate the relationship between the brain and behaviour in current research, but observations from autopsy, stroke and accident victims have all contributed to understanding of the brain and behaviour. One or more examples of a technological technique used to understand the brain and behaviour can be used.\n Localization: Students should understand the concept of localization and how the function of different parts of the brain is determined as well as the limitations of this model.\n Areas of the human brain related to behaviour: An awareness of where the regions of the brain referred to in the research are helps to contextualize learning.\n Neuroplasticity: The development of neural networks through repetition and neural pruning is both genetic and subject to environmental influences. Neural networks can change developmentally, over time or after injury. This is termed neuroplasticity.\n Neurotransmitters and their effect on behaviour: The effect of neurotransmitters on human behaviour can be explained using an appropriate example. Neurotransmitters allow the impulse to cross a synapse (excitatory) or stop the impulse and prevent it from crossing a synapse (inhibitory). Neurotransmitters are themselves affected by agonists which amplify their effect and antagonists which reduce their effect. As a result, neurons working together can produce a large variety of effects resulting in a complex repertoire of behaviours. As a result any claim of cause and effect should be treated with caution.\n Neural transmission: It is sufficient for students to know that nerve impulses travel along neurons until they reach a synapse. The details of how this is achieved are not required.\n Neurotransmitters: Neurotransmitters mediate the events at the synapse. There are many neurotransmitters in the human brain. Serotonin and dopamine are two of the better known. Many hormones can also act as neurotransmitters, for example, adrenaline and oxytocin. One or more examples can be used to illustrate the effect of neurotransmitters.\n Neural networks: Neural networks in the brain develop by the making and breaking of synaptic connections between neurons.\n  Hormones and behaviour  Hormones and behaviour: The effect of a hormone on human behaviour can be examined using one or more examples.\n Hormones: Hormones are chemicals released by specific glands in the body to regulate medium- and long-term changes in the body. Some hormones, for example, adrenaline, also act as neurotransmitters and can produce instantaneous effects on mood and attention. One or more examples can be used to study hormonal effects on behaviour.\n Pheromones and behaviour: There is increasing evidence that pheromones may play a role in human behaviour, however, none are conclusive. A discussion on the effect of pheromones on behaviour is a useful exercise in critical thinking. Note: it is not an interesting excercise in thinking, but rather reading. And reading it says that it is not conclusive in a slightest\n Pheromones: The arguments for and against the influence of pheromones on human behaviour can be assessed critically using one or more examples.\n  Genetics and behaviour  Genes and behaviour: The evidence for links between genes and certain types of behaviour requires critical evaluation in the light of environmental factors.\n Nature of the gene: Genes are made up of DNA which provides the blueprint for the structure and function of the human body. This could include behaviour. An individual’s genome refers to all the genes that individual possesses. The link between genes and behaviour can be studied using one or more examples.\n Gene regulation and gene expression: Not all genes an individual possesses are expressed at all times. Genes can be switched on and off. This is gene regulation resulting in differential gene expression. Therefore, having a gene for a particular behaviour does not necessarily mean that an individual will exhibit that behaviour.\n Factors that affect gene expression: Genes are switched on and off by signals from inside and outside the body. Internal signals include the presence of hormones or other chemicals, or indeed other genes. Hormones are frequently produced as a result of environmental events and work by altering gene expression. There are countless environmental events that also affect gene expression. The signal activates special proteins that an promote or block the expression of a gene. Genes are constantly being switched on and off. Sometimes genes are permanently switched off. This is mostly achieved by methylation of the DNA molecule as part of the developmental process. This effect on genes is sometimes referred to as epigenetics as there is no alteration in the actual structure of the DNA. Mutations occur when there is an actual alteration of the DNA.\n Genetic similarities: Genetic similarity is referred to as relatedness. The greater the genetic similarities between two individuals or a group of individuals the higher the degree of relatedness. An awareness of the degree of relatedness between MZ and DZ twins, siblings, parents and children, and parents and adopted children provides a critical perspective in evaluating twin or kinship studies.\n Evolutionary explanations for behaviour: If genes code for behaviour as well as physical traits, then behaviour is subject to evolutionary pressures in the same way that physical traits are subject to evolutionary pressures.\n Survival of the fittest and natural selection: Competition for scarce resources, like food or mates, leads to the promotion of favourable traits. These traits may be physical or behavioural. Whatever their nature, they are regarded as favourable traits as they allow the individual to acquire sufficient resources in order to survive and reproduce. When the individual reproduces, it passes these traits on to the next generation. The more they reproduce, the more individuals will have the trait in the next generation. This is survival of the fittest by natural selection. Genetics and environmental challenges are therefore both important in the success of specific traits and behaviour. Evolutionary explanations for behaviour can be studied using one or more examples.\n  The role of animal research in understanding human behaviour The role of animal research in understanding human behaviour For all three topics in the biological approach, and with reference to research studies, HL students should study the following:\n The value of animal models in psychology research. Whether animal research can provide insight into human behaviour. Ethical considerations in animal research.  "

All three questions are compulsory. Each question is marked out of 9 marks using the rubric below, for a total of 27 marks.\n   Markband Level descriptor     0 The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.   1–3 The response is of limited relevance to or only rephrases the question. Knowledge and understanding is mostly inaccurate or not relevant to the question. The research supporting the response is mostly not relevant to the question and if relevant only listed.   4–6 The response is relevant to the question, but does not meet the command term requirements. Knowledge and understanding is accurate but limited. The response is supported by appropriate research which is described.   7–9 The response is fully focused on the question and meets the command term requirements. Knowledge and understanding is accurate and addresses the main topics/problems identified in the question. The response is supported by appropriate research which is described and explicitly linked to the question.    Long answer question Paper 1 has one long answer question and paper 2 has two long answer questions in HL and 1 in SL.\nCriterion A: Focus on the question (2 marks) To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.\n   Mark Level descriptor     0 Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.   1 Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.   2 Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.    Criterion B: Knowledge and understanding (6 marks) This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.\n   Mark Level descriptor     0 Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.   1–2 The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding. Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.   3–4 The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail. Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.   5–6 The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding. Psychological terminology is used appropriately.    Criterion C: Use of research to support answer (6 marks) Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.\n   Mark Level descriptor     0 Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.   1–2 Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves to repeat points already made.   3–4 Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is partly explained. Research selected partially develops the argument.   5–6 Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.    Criterion D: Critical thinking (6 marks) This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical thinking on the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical thinking are:\n research design and methodologies triangulation assumptions and biases contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations areas of uncertainty.  These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic judgment of their achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.\n   Mark Level descriptor     0 Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.   1–2 There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.   3–4 The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.   5–6 The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking. Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.    Criterion E: Clarity and organization (2 marks) This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought underpinning the argument.\n   Mark Level descriptor     0 Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.   1 The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout the response.   2 The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

Biologists can measure protein quantities, physicists can measure time it takes for a pendulum to swing, but we never directly measure memory. We usually say we measure intelligence, friendliness, happiness, but we don\u0026rsquo;t. We construct the term of happiness and then we devise a method to measure it. So it can be biased, it can be wrong, it can be challenged. But that is OK :)\nWhereas definition talks about what a thing like happiness is, operationalisation speaks of a process of actually measuring it. It derives from the definition. If we say that happy are those who have money, then operationalisation of happiness is the quantity of money. If we define intelligence as an ability to solve tasks, we create a tests which ask people to solve tasks which we consider that \u0026ldquo;intelligent\u0026rdquo; people should solve. But mistakes can happen.\nOld intelligence tests for example tackled a lot of mathematical thinking or memory, completely ignoring verbal or spatial skills. Some tests of memory asked people to remember numbers, ignoring that some people are rubbish at remembering numbers but they can remember thousands of faces and names. How we define and how we operationalise our terms will define if our research is valid.\nTypes of experimental design Within subject design Between subject design Matched pairs "

	"content": " The cognitive approach to understanding behaviour looks at:\n cognitive processing (SL and HL) reliability of cognitive processes (SL and HL) emotion and cognition (SL and HL) cognitive processing in the digital world (HL only).  Relevant to all the topics are:\n the contribution of research methods used in the cognitive approach to understanding human behaviour ethical considerations in the investigation of the cognitive approach to understanding human behaviour.  The cognitive approach to behaviour views human beings as processors of information much in the same way as a computer processes information. The cognitive approach to behaviour focuses on areas of research such as schema processing, memory processing, and thinking, and how cognition may influence behaviour. Researchers are also interested in the extent to which cognitive processes are reliable, for example, in relation to thinking and memory. How cognitive processes may be affected in the modern digitalized world is an emerging field within the cognitive approach to behaviour.\nCognitive processes are often influenced in complex ways by emotions. The influence of emotions on cognitive processes is studied not only by cognitive psychologists, but is developing as an area of interest for cognitive neuroscientists as well as social psychologists.\nResearch methods in the cognitive approach to understanding of behaviour rely on experiments and brain imaging technologies as well as qualitative approaches to understanding everyday memory and thinking, making the cognitive approach an example of the holistic approach to understanding human behaviour.\nCognitive processing  Models of memory: The Multi-Store Model of Memory and The Working Memory Model provide a framework for an understanding of conceptualization of human memory processes over time. The working memory model is an elaboration of short-term memory, suggesting a number of components working together to process information.\n Concepts related to memory processing: Relevant concepts within the study of models of memory, for example explicit/implicit memory, sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, central executive, phonological loop, episodic buffer, visuospatial sketchpad.\n Schema theory: Cognitive schemas are seen as mental representations that organize our knowledge, beliefs and expectations. Multiple studies have indicated that schemas influence memory processes in encoding, storage and retrieval. Schema processing is to a large extent automatic and non-conscious which saves cognitive energy but at the same time could result in biases in thinking and memory processes.\n Schema processing: Relevant concepts related to studying schema processing could be but are not limited to: top down, bottom up processing, pattern recognition, the matching of a current input to information in memory, effort after meaning—the attempt to match unfamiliar ideas into a familiar framework, stereotyping—an example of schema processing based on a fixed mental representation of a group of individuals.\n Thinking and decision-making: Thinking involves using information and doing something with it, for example, deciding something. Thinking and decision-making are thus closely related. Thinking is based on factors such as concepts, processes, and goals. Modern research into thinking and decision-making often refers to rational (controlled) and intuitive thinking (automatic). There is an increasing understanding of how emotions may influence thinking and the decision-making process because the consequences of decisions result in the experiencing of emotions and many of our choices are guided by the experience of or anticipation of such emotions.\n Thinking and decision-making concepts: Relevant concepts related to studying thinking and decision-making could be but are not limited to framing, heuristics, loss aversion, and appraisal.\n Types of thinking: There are two systems models of thinking: system 1—intuitive, automatic, quick and requiring limited effort, influenced by biases and system 2—rational, goal directed, requires intentional effort and time, analyses/controls for biases.\n Models of thinking and decision-making: theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behaviour (concerned with the relationship between attitudes and behaviour when making choices), the adapative decision-maker framework including emotions and goals in the decision processl, mindset theory arguing that thinking about one\u0026rsquo;s ability is related to decisions of investment in performance\n  Reliability of cognitive processes  Reconstructive memory: Human memory is not an exact copy of events but rather a reconstruction that may be altered over time, through discussions with others or input from the media. Research shows that memory may be changed during storage, processing and retrieval, for example, due to schema processing. Knowing this could be important not only in our daily lives but in particular in relation to eyewitness testimony.\n Factors related to the study of reconstructive memory: Relevant concepts related to studying the nature of reconstructive memory could be but are not limited to, confabulation( memory based on a fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted memory often believed to be true in spite of contradictory evidence), schema processing—memory (processing based on prior knowledge in the form of schemas which could result in distortion), false memories (recalling an event that never happened and believing it to be true).\n Biases in thinking and decision-making: Human beings are not always rational thinkers. Instead they rely on intuitive thinking and take cognitive shortcuts resulting in a number of well-researched biases. The tendency to focus on a limited amount of available information, to seek out information that confirms preexisting beliefs as well as the tendency to avoid the mental stress of holding inconsistent cognitions seem to be common sources of biases in thinking and decision-making.\n Factors involved in biased thinking and decision-making: Relevant concepts related to studying factors involved in biased thinking and decision-making could be but are not limited to rational versus intuitive thinking, heuristics, algorithms, anchoring, framing and representativeness as well as these cognitive biases: confirmation bias (the tendency to seek out information to confirm what you already believe), cognitive dissonance (a socalled motivational bias that focuses on personal motivation for selection and interpretation of information so that your cognitions are consistent with your decisions and/or behaviour), optimism bias (the tendency to think that nothing bad will ever happen to you), selective attention (the tendency to focus on a limited amount of stimuli when several are occurring at the same time), illusory correlations (the tendency to incorrectly identify correlations where there are none, as for example in “implicit personality theories”)\n  Emotion and cognition  The influence of emotion on cognitive processes: Psychological and neuroscientific research has revealed that emotion and cognition are intertwined. Emotions are believed to perform an adaptive function in that they shape the experience of events and guide the individual in how to react to events, objects and situations with reference to personal relevance and well-being. Memories of emotional events sometimes have a persistence and vividness that other memories seem to lack but there is evidence that even highly emotional memories may fade over time.\n Cognition and emotion: Psychological and neuroscientific research indicates a relationship between cognition and emotion. Emotion influences our perception of the world and how we remember. Relevant concepts related to studying emotion and memory processes could be but are not limited to, flashbulb memories, theory of the emotional brain, the amygdala\u0026rsquo;s influence on memory encoding,appraisal, state-dependent memory. Biases in thinking and decision-making can be studied using one or more examples.\n The influence of emotion on cognitive processes: The influence of emotion on cognitive processes can be studied using one or more examples.\n  Cognitive processing in the digital world (HL)  Cognitive processing in the digital world: For all three topics in the cognitive approach, and with reference to research studies, HL students should study the following. The influence of digital technology on cognitive processes and human interaction. The positive and negative effects of modern technology on cognitive processes. Methods used to study the interaction between digital technology and cognitive processes.  "

	"content": " Sampling is a process of selecting part of target population to be studied. In an optimal world, we would measure everybody. Measuring everybody would allow us to perfectly describe the population and get to something called \u0026ldquo;True mean\u0026rdquo;. If we get everybody\u0026rsquo;s height, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to run statistics. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; for group differences, we can be certain about our assertions regardless of statistics.\nBut we are not in an wishful and perfect world adn we only can measure a fixed amout of people - only a hundred inhabitants of France. How then we pick those that perfectly represent the entire population of France? Entire population of Young adults?Entire population of home schooled children?\nTerminology  Population: Our target group. In cognitive psychology this is often \u0026ldquo;everybody\u0026rdquo; as we are interested in how memory, perception works regardless of cultural or social background. In social psych it can be only those people from a particular social background ora culture, in abnormal psychology it can be only people suffering from a particular disease. In some cases (e.g Being sane in insane places) we may be actually interested in \u0026ldquo;hospitals\u0026rdquo;, or agencies or groups of individuals rather than people. Sampling: Procedure of selecting individuals form our population into our sample. Sample: The final sample of people we ended up with.     Research question Population Ideal practical sample Real sample     How many faces can human memory store? Everybody 200 random people from around the world 60 people from PSYCH 101 class   Is the new antipsychotic drug better than the previous one? All patients on the previous drug/all patients 100 random patients from countries where the drug is going to be sold 15 patients from John Hopkins or any other hospital willing to participate   Do the new contraception pills affect cognitive skills? All women on contraceptives 200 random women on contraceptives 30 women who visit gynaecologist who is being paid to do the study   How do babies interact with their peers? All babies between 0 to 3 years 50 observations in different situations and settings 10 observations done in a kindergarten close to the research lab    Sampling bias Sampling bias = not selecting a sample representative of the population\nTime, money and personnel troubles arise in random samples, biases in nonprobability samples\nIt is not clearly stated why a sample was selected in this way\nThe research conclusion does not reflect sampling bias –Research claims that all students are lazy, but only tested students in two classes in three high schools in Virginia\n##Sampling process\n Define research question: English language acquisition in adults Define concerned population: 18-65 non-native English speakers : Define resources available:money, time, personnel Determine sampling method: opportunity sampling – English course taught at the university for foreign PhD students Do the sampling Do the research Evaluate Do it again  Sampling methods Probability methods\nNon probability methods\nRandom sampling Every person in target population has an equal chance of ending in the sample. Usually done by making a list of all the people in the population and then randomly selecting N names.\n   Pros Cons     Statistically the best solution, Least troubles defending it before other scientists Where do you get the list of people to randomize from?, Nearly impossible in most cases, Time and money issues, Large decay of sample (just selecting people does not mean they will participate), Not necessarily the best in all cases, People usually refuse or they feel their anonymity was breached (where did you get my contact??)    Cluster Sampling Rather than selecting each individual in target population, we focus on clusters where these people occur in larger groups (workplace, school, clubs etc.). Every group then has an equal chance of ending in a sample. Therefore we select a four football clubs and text all their members (N = 110), rather than selecting 110 players from across the country.\n   Pros Cons     Much cheaper, Fast – people come to clubs/schools on their own volition, Focused groups Very biased (we can select the best group or the worst), The bias is usually multiplied by the number of people in the cluster (30 bright students, vs 30 average students), Needs permission of the entire club/class/school    Stratified sampling Selecting random sample from within subgroups defined by the research aim. You want to draw a stratified sample of 50 children from a school containing 75% girls and 25% boys-\u0026gt; girls need to be three times as likely to be in the sample.\n   Pros Cons     Very targeted and focused on the question, Allows for smaller samples while maintaining validity and statistical power, Allows for controlling of extraneous variables You need to know the subgroups and extraneous variables before the research takes place, sometimes this is not achievable, it is easier than to just give people questionnaire and control for variables using statistics    Opportunity sampling People simply apply to participate in the research for university credit, money or just out of curiosity. Or researchers ask friends, relatives etc. They usually need to meet certain criteria (e.g. males 25-36 in a relationship; students of visual arts; people working in an international company etc.)\n   Pros Cons     Fast and convenient, People usually come to you, Universities promote research, Sometimes it just doesn’t matter, who participates, so why make it hard? Extremely biased in most cases, Cannot be easily generalised to population, Somewhat unethical    Sampling vs controlling Sampling is a process of selecting people from target population Controlling is a process of eliminating extraneous variables\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " The extended essay (EE) is an in-depth study of a focused topic chosen from the list of available Diploma Programme subjects. Word limit of the essay is 4000 words. Final possible grade is A-E (E is the failing condition, student will not get the diploma in that case).\nAim of extended essay:\n Investigate in depth a topic of your choice within the subject Develop your skills in research, analysis and evaluation, and communication  Choice of topic in Psychology EE Psychology may be defined as “the study of behaviour”. The subject involves studying the behaviours of humans and non-human animals and has a range of specialist terms, methods and literature. It is therefore essential for students undertaking an EE in psychology to:\n have a sound understanding of the subject and its methodologies choose a topic amenable to psychological investigation and analysis.  EE must be based on secondary sources only (the collection of primary data is not permitted for the psychology EE) and these must be peer-reviewed. Therefore \u0026ldquo;pop-psychology\u0026rdquo; kind of topic are not suitable. Title of EE must be formed from the specified topic and research question (in form of the question). Usual process of choosing the research question:\n Choose a field in psychology of your particular interest Refine this choice to a specific topic develop a research question on this topic.  For example, a student might be interested in stress. They may then narrow this to the topic of stress within commercial aviation. Many large commercial airlines employ psychologists to investigate pilot performance and factors such as stress or emergency management. The student’s research question could be: “To what extent does airline pilot stress affect airline safety standards?” The research question should require the construction of a systematically structured and fully supported argument in the development of an informed conclusion. Students must ensure that enough relevant and appropriate resources are available for them to conduct their research. They should investigate this at the start of their planning process.\nTreatment of topic in Psychology EE Primary versus secondary data Primary data collected using the students’ own experiments, surveys, observations and case studies is inappropriate for the EE. Instead, students must use secondary data from published sources. They should develop their argument with careful and appropriate citation of relevant concepts, theories and studies from academic psychological research journals and books. Students should not make any assertions unsupported by evidence drawn from psychological theories or studies.\nAnalysis and discussion and evaluation To develop a well-rounded understanding of their topic, students should carefully evaluate any research they cite. The essay should offer a balanced argument in response to the research question. Students should demonstrate critical awareness and understanding of the material they use. They should analyse rather than simply describe. They need to apply what they have read to the research question rather than report the information. One of the aims of all group 3 subjects is to enable the students to recognize that the content and methodologies of the subjects in group 3 are wide ranging and require students to critically evaluate the choices they make with regard to methodologies. An EE in psychology should demonstrate such understanding. The Psychology guide introduces a framework for evaluation. It trains students to address cultural, ethical, gender and methodological considerations potentially affecting how a particular study or theory interprets behaviour. Comparative analysis may also be a useful evaluative strategy. Students should keep these considerations in mind when selecting a topic, generating a research question and developing their argument.\nEthical guidelines The IB has published a set of ethical guidelines that apply to the psychology EE and internal assessment task. Many topics within psychology are sensitive in nature. Students should consider carefully all possible ethical issues before they embark on their essay. Students and supervisors share the responsibility for ensuring it does not breach the guidelines.\nAn important note on “double-dipping” Students must ensure that their EE does not duplicate other work they are submitting for the Diploma Programme. In particular, an EE in psychology is not an extension of the internal assessment (IA) task. Students must ensure that they understand the differences between the two. Students and supervisors share the responsibility for ensuring the EE differs in intent, content, methodology and outcome from the IA.\nSupervisors play an important role in guiding students on these distinctions. Students risk their diploma if academic misconduct is detected.An important note on “double-dipping”. Students must ensure that their EE does not duplicate other work they are submitting for the Diploma Programme.\n"

Marking 1 point per each correct consideration applied to a maximum of 3 max, 1 point per application [2 max], 1 point per extra point not in the description\nQuestion 3 Question 3 will consist of one of the following questions, for a total of 9 marks. The question will be assessed using the rubric below.\n Discuss the possibility of generalizing the findings of the study. Discuss how a researcher could ensure that the results of the study are credible. Discuss how the researcher in the study could avoid bias.     Markband Level descriptor     0 The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.   1–3 The question is misunderstood and the central issue is not identified correctly, resulting in a mostly irrelevant argument. The response contains mostly inaccurate references to the approaches to research or these are irrelevant to the question. The reference to the stimulus material relies heavily on direct quotations from the text.   4–6 The question is understood, but only partially answered resulting in an argument of limited scope. The response contains mostly accurate references to approaches to research which are linked explicitly to the question. The response makes appropriate but limited use of the stimulus material.   7–9 The question is understood and answered in a focused and effective manner with an accurate argument that addresses the requirements of the question.    The response contains accurate references to approaches to research with regard to the question, describing their strengths and limitations. The response makes effective use of the stimulus material.\nMarking Examples "

	"content": " Students should be familiar with the following key terms and phrases used in examination questions, which are to be understood as described below. Although these terms will be used frequently in examination questions, other terms may be used to direct students to present an argument in a specific way. The command terms used in psychology are arranged into four groups labelled assessment objectives (AO). The first three, AO1, AO2 and AO3, are hierarchical with more challenging verbs for assessment as you progress from AO1 to AO3. AO4 is not hierarchical, but represents actions related to subject-specific tasks.\nAssessment objective 1 (AO1) Knowledge and comprehension of specified content. These terms require students to demonstrate knowledge and understanding and learn and comprehend the meaning of information.\n   Term Description     Describe Give a detailed account.   Identify Provide an answer from a number of possibilities.   Outline Give a brief account or summary.    Assessment objective 2 (AO2) Application and analysis of knowledge and understanding. These terms require students to use and analyse knowledge and understanding, explain actual situations, break down ideas into simpler parts and to see how the parts relate.\n   Term Description     Comment Give a judgment based on a given statement or result of a calculation.   Explain Give a detailed account including reasons or causes.   Suggest Propose a solution, hypothesis or other possible answer.    Assessment objective 3 (AO3) Synthesis and evaluation. These terms require students to make a judgment based on evidence and, when relevant, construct an argument or rearrange component ideas into a new whole and make judgments based on evidence or a set of criteria.\n   Term Description     Contrast Give an account of the differences between two (or more) items or situations, referring to both (all) of them throughout.   Discuss Offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.   Evaluate Make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and limitations.   To what extent Consider the merits or otherwise of an argument or concept. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.    Assessment objective 4 (AO4) Selection and use of skills appropriate to psychology. The terms require students to take action.\n   Term Description     Design Produce a plan, simulation or model.   Investigate Observe, study, or make a detailed and systematic examination, in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions.   Predict Give an expected result.    "

	"description": "",
	"content": " All research needs to abide any law in a country where it is conducted, but that is often not enough to make sure that participants are treated with dignity and respect. Until ethics in psychological research has been \u0026ldquo;established\u0026rdquo; and certain rules codified, researchers often conducted studies which might have had lasting implications on their participants without necessary precautions being made. For that reason, certain (legally still not forcable) rules were introduced and ethical review processes established.\nNeedless to say,\nBelmont report National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the 1978 issues a report on proper behavioural and biomedicinal research.\nThe three fundamental ethical principles for using any human subjects for research are:\n Respect for persons: protecting the autonomy of all people and treating them with courtesy and respect and allowing for informed consent. Researchers must be truthful and conduct no deception; Beneficence: The philosophy of \u0026ldquo;Do no harm\u0026rdquo; while maximizing benefits for the research project and minimizing risks to the research subjects; and Justice: ensuring reasonable, non-exploitative, and well-considered procedures are administered fairly — the fair distribution of costs and benefits to potential research participants — and equally.  That is being put into practice through\n Informed consent Assessment of Risk and Benefits Selection of Subjects  While scientist\u0026rsquo;s curiosity is a good reason to conduct a research, it is not a completely good reason to take away time from people. Thus any study requiring participation from human subjects should assess it\u0026rsquo;s benefits to justify the means. As far as a concrete specific practices, there are certain rights each participant has and which should be followed:\n Right to know about the purpose of the study (informed consent, debriefing, results sharing) Right for fair treatment (right to quit the study at any point) Right to remain anonymous  IRB reveiw Institutional Review Board serves as a corrector of possible malpractices spiralling in any given institution. Although not always required by law, IRBs are a necessary element of a research institution to make sure that research is not only abiding by the law, but also by the Human Rights or the rules established by the Belmont report.\nIRB is presented with a full documentation of a research proposal, including but not limited to:\n topic and purpose of the study research design and procedure type of data to be collected (what type of personal data are you collecting, are you collecting any personal identificators) location of data storage (where will you keep the data and how will you assure anonymity, how will you make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t lose it?) description of a population (who will be in the sample and why) sampling procedure (how will you sample and why) informed consent (what is in and how to obtain) risks and benefits for participants (debriefing)  appendices usually include:\n list of responsible personal who will interact with participants informed consent recruitment adds, flyers etc. any research material (such as images, questionnaires)  Some elements which IRB review will discuss include\n Assessment if the study can\u0026rsquo;t be done in another way - if participants are lied to, is there really no other way where that is not possible? Does it need to take 8 hours? Assessment is the study is worth it - if the benefits for the field are not significant, it might not get a pass (problems for replication studies) Assessment if the research is just - it benefits all people the same, not only a certain minority Assessment of research sample and possible misuse of power relationship - special protection of minorities, such as prisoners, children etc. Using prisoners for a prison related research is fine, selecting them for a study of visual acuity is probably bordering misuse of power. Assessment of conflict of interest  Types of IRB review There are generally three types of IRB review process.\n Exempt - no review necessary (you still submit all the materials, but ask for an exempt based) Expedited - fast review for studies posing no more than minimal risk for the subject Full - full board review, usually for studies involving children, minorities or posing more than minimal risk  Which category falls on your research is based on specific criteria at a particular institution, but some rules are generally the same across the board:\nExempt from IRB review is research:\n with non identifiable subjects using existing and publicly available information research in educational settings for the immediate benefit which will not lead to identification of individuals research or demonstration for public benefit food liking research in shopping malls :)  Expedited IRB review will be available for research:\n posing no more than minimal risk where identification of participants would not place them at risk which is not classified  Other ethical issues The ethical questions do not end with the study being over. Researchers are still responsible for the data to remain anonymous, but in some case also for the data \u0026ldquo;not to get lost\u0026rdquo; or not to get to the wrong hands. Researchers are also responsible for the correct interpretation of their results which is in concordance with the assessment of benefits - e.g. if the study was about visual acuity but the data is eventually used to asses racial differences based on the visual processing, that should require a new IRB review.\nCorrect reporting of results is also in accordance with the first rule of the Belomont report. The participants gave us their time and we should respect their decision and use their contribution in a meaningul manner. In that sense, not publishing collected data is sometimes also considered unethical, although there is a battle between not publishing collected data and publishing misinterpreted research results (as you never know, what data will you get).\n  Attachments   describe-etical-issues.pdf  (35 ko)   discussing-ethical-issues.pdf  (49 ko)   ethics-case-examples.pdf  (77 ko)   ethics-terminology.pdf  (20 ko)   sample-informed-consent-stanford.docx  (24 ko)   sample-irb-san-siego.doc  (427 ko)   stamford-exempt-irb.pdf  (55 ko)   stamford-expedited-irb.pdf  (52 ko)   the-belmont-report.pdf  (120 ko)   truly-unethical-research.docx  (13 ko)   yale-irb-requirement.pdf  (23 ko)    "

	"content": "The experiment for the internal assessment must adhere to the ethical guidelines outlined below.\n Any experimental study that creates anxiety, stress, pain or discomfort for participants is not permitted. Experiments involving deception, conformity, obedience, or any other form of harm are not permitted. The experiment must be appropriate to the sensitivities of the particular school, community and country. Any experimental study that involves unjustified deception, involuntary participation or invasion of privacy, including the inappropriate use of information and communication technology (ICT), email and the internet, must be avoided. There may be rare occasions when such infringements cannot be avoided, in which case the approval of other experienced psychologists should be sought before proceeding. Partial deception may be allowed for some experiments where full knowledge of the experiment would fundamentally affect the outcome—such experiments are permissible provided they do no harm and participants are fully debriefed at the end. Participants retain their right to withdraw their data at this point. The only exception is a conformity or obedience study; these are not permitted under any circumstances. The teacher should be ready and willing to explain why conformity and obedience experiments are not appropriate for students at this level of study. Consent must be explicitly gained from participants through the use of a consent form. Implied consent is not acceptable. All participants must be informed of the aims and objectives of the experiment. All participants must be informed before commencing the experimental study that they have the right to withdraw at any time. Pressure must not be placed on any individual participant to continue with the investigation. Young children (under 12 years) must not be used as participants as they cannot give informed consent. Experimental studies involving older children (from 12 years up to 16 years) need the written consent of parent(s) or guardian(s). Students must ensure that parents are fully informed about the implications for children who take part in such research. Where an experimental study is conducted with children in a school, the written consent of the teachers concerned must also be obtained. Participants must be debriefed and given the right to withdraw their own personal data and responses. Anonymity for each participant must be guaranteed even after the experiment has finished. Participants must be shown the results of the research and if reasonable deception was involved, the participants must have the deception explained and justified to them. Teachers and students must exercise the greatest sensitivity to local and international cultures. Students must not conduct research with any participant who is not in a fit state of mind and cannot respond freely and independently. If any participant shows stress or pain at any stage of an experimental study, the investigation must finish immediately, and the participant must be allowed to withdraw. Non-human animals must not be used for the experimental study. All data collected must be kept in a confidential and responsible manner and not disclosed to any other person. Data must not be used for purposes other than that agreed to by the participants. Students must regard it as their duty to monitor the ways in which their peers conduct research, and to encourage public re-evaluation of any research practices that breach these guidelines. Experimental studies that are conducted online are subject to the same guidelines. Any data collected online must be deleted once the research is complete. Such data must not be used for any purpose other than the conduct of the experimental study. Teachers who feel the need for more guidance on whether an experiment is ethical should consult other teachers via the OCC who may offer additional expertise and critical distance.  For the experiment to be considered ethical, it must do no harm to anyone (also see section “Approaches to the Independent Variable” above). This includes participants, researchers, bystanders, teachers/supervisors, moderators, and eventual readers. Teachers should be prepared to discuss and explain what “harm” means. It can mean a number of things: hurt, injure, torment, tease, torture, traumatize, impair, wound, mistreat, punish, maltreat, misuse,abuse, molest, damage, or adversely affect. Harm manifests in many ways, not only in a physical sense. High standards of ethical practice are central to the IB philosophy and should therefore be promoted and supported by the entire IB community.\n"

	"content": " This activity focuses on students ability to read and understand even complex articles. It\u0026rsquo;s goal isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily for the student to understand everything in the text, but to be able to pinpoint important parts and to discuss valid points the article makes.\nThe activity follows classes on research. Students are given each question immediately after appropriate lesson has been covered (e.g. question 10 after ethics have been gone through). In the end, students hand out a summary of a scientific paper.\nGoal Teaching students how to read research which might be a bit over their heads with its complexity. Showing the plethora of methodologies used. Showing the structure that scientific articles usually have (IMRD). Learning to think critically about conducted research - was it done well? Does it actually answer the question it set to answer?\nStructure Let students select a paper from a list of approved studies. Read through one paper together in class and answer all questions - even those which they don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are - sometimes, some students do :)\nLet them \u0026ldquo;browse\u0026rdquo; the paper and answer questions 1-4. Then, after each lesson on a particular topic (say methods, ethics, statistics), give them those questions to answer as well. After all questions have been answered (usually 3-4 weeks) ,give them extra week to finalize the report.\nSchedule in points  Go over one psych paper together (procrastionation by Dan Ariely)\n Read the article and Answer questions 1-4 - even though they don’t know perfectly how or they don\u0026rsquo;t understand the entire paper\n Get their answers and give brief pointers. Do not mark at this point\n Get back to each question as you do each appropriate section (sampling, ethics) and ask them to hand you answer to those questions as you cover the lessons.\n After all questions have been answered, give them one week to \u0026ldquo;finalize\u0026rdquo; the report.\n Get their new answers (and mark them).\n  Questions  What was the purpose of the study\n What were the hypotheses?\n What was the conclusion?\n What did the authors say that can be a problem with their conclusion?\n What was the method used for the research? Describe it and explain whhy it was chosen.\n What was the research design used? (within subject, between subject, matched pairs)\n What other methods could authors use to study their theory? Describe at least one and compare it to the one they used.\n If the research had independent and dependent variables, describe what they were and how they were operationalised.\n Can the results be generalized to bigger sample? To which one and which one not?\n Does the research seem valid? (Or does it strike you as weird, too laboratory, not well designed, unusable etc.) Explain and provide examples.\n What was the sampling method used in the paper?\n Was the sampling method well chosen? Explain and provide alternatives.\n Was the research conducted ethically according to the principles laid out by the Belmont report? State why - what was done and what wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\n Does the research follow the APA code link?\n Was there some potential danger regardless of the ethical requirements being supposedly met? How it could have been prevented or diminished?\n  Recomended journals    Authors Title Journal Full journal Publication year     Ambady N,Rosenthal R Half a minute: Predicting teacher evaluations from thin slices of nonverbal behavior and physical attractiveness J.

It assesses the explanation of the focus of the research (this includes the topic and the research question), how the research will be undertaken, and how the focus is maintained throughout the essay.\n   Level Descriptor of strands and indicators     0 The work does not reach a standard outlined by the descriptors below.   1–2 The topic is communicated unclearly and incompletely.dentification and explanation of the topic is limited; the purpose and focus of the research is unclear, or does not lend itself to a systematic investigation in the subject for which it is registered. The research question is stated but not clearly expressed or too broad.The research question is too broad in scope to be treated effectively within the word limit and requirements of the task, or does not lend itself to a systematic investigation in the subject for which it is registered. The intent of the research question is understood but has not been clearly expressed and/or the discussion of the essay is not focused on the research question.Methodology of the research is limited.The source(s) and/or method(s) to be used are limited in range given the topic and research question.There is limited evidence that their selection was informed.   3-4 The topic is communicatedIdentification and explanation of the research topic is communicated; the purpose and focus of the research is adequately clear, but only partially appropriateThe research question is clearly stated but only partially focused.The research question is clear but the discussion in the essay is only partially focused and connected to the research question. Methodology of the research is mostly complete.Source(s) and/or method(s) to be used are generally relevant and appropriate given the topic and research question.There is some evidence that their selection(s) was informed.If the topic or research question is deemed inappropriate for the subject in which the essay is registered no more than four marks can be awarded for this criterion   5-6 The topic is communicated accurately and effectivelyIdentification and explanation of the research topic is effectively communicated; the purpose and focus of the research is clear and appropriate.The research question is clearly stated and focusedThe research question is clear and addresses an issue of research that is appropriately connected to the discussion in the essayMethodology of the research is complete.An appropriate range of relevant source(s) and/or method(s) has been selected in relation to the topic and research question.There is evidence of effective and informed selection of sources and/or methods.    Criterion A: Psychology specifics guidance Students should state their choice of topic clearly at the start of the EE. The research question must be: - expressed in question format - very precise - able to be fully addressed within the word limit. It should be clear to the reader how the question relates to and is derived from the knowledge and understanding of the topic under consideration.\nThe introduction should provide the academic context and subsequent justification for the research question. The student should show how and why it is relevant for consideration in an academic context, indicating the current state of research and the discussions raised.\nAlthough their personal interest in the topic is important, students’ personal experiences and opinions are inappropriate here. Students must explain their approach to the topic. Their explanation needs to: - outline the remit of the essay - indicate the psychological theories and studies they will use and how - enable the reader to see how the focus of the essay is to be maintained.\nPsychological journals and books are appropriate resources. Materials from “pop psychology” and items from the media do not offer sufficient depth and academic rigour to develop an informed and balanced argument. Students must select appropriate resources and make explicit reference to the research question throughout the essay to score highly against this criterion. Where a student considers neuro-cognitive processing in relation to a behaviour, the focus of their essay should be on its impact on the behaviour or experience of the individual rather than on description of biological processing, however detailed and accurate. If the topic or research question is deemed inappropriate for the subject in which the essay is registered, no more than four marks can be awarded for this criterion. This applies to psychology essays that are based on the collection of primary data.\nCriterion B: Knowledge and understanding This criterion assesses the extent to which the research relates to the subject area/discipline used to explore the research question, or in the case of the world studies extended essay, the issue addressed and the two disciplinary perspectives applied, and additionally the way in which this knowledge and understanding is demonstrated through the use of appropriate terminology and concepts.\n   Level Descriptor of strands and indicators     0 The work does not reach a standard outlined by the descriptors below.   1–2 Knowledge and understanding is limited.The application of source material has limited relevance and is only partially appropriate to the research question.Knowledge of the topic/discipline(s)/issue is anecdotal, unstructured and mostly descriptive with sources not effectively being used.Use of terminology and concepts is unclear and limited.Subject-specific terminology and/or concepts are either missing or inaccurate, demonstrating limited knowledge and understanding.   3-4  Knowledge and understanding is good.The application of source material is mostly relevant and appropriate to the research question.Knowledge of the topic/discipline(s)/issue is clear; there is an understanding of the sources used but their application is only partially effective.Use of terminology and concepts is adequate.The use of subject-specific terminology and concepts is mostly accurate, demonstrating an appropriate level of knowledge and understanding.If the topic or research question is deemed inappropriate for the subject in which the essay is registered no more than four marks can be awarded for this criterion.   5-6  Knowledge and understanding is excellent.The application of source materials is clearly relevant and appropriate to the research question.Knowledge of the topic/discipline(s)/issue is clear and coherent and sources are used effectively and with understanding.Use of terminology and concepts is good.The use of subject-specific terminology and concepts is accurate and consistent, demonstrating effective knowledge and understanding.    Criterion B: Psychology specifics guidance Students can provide evidence in several ways that they clearly understand the concepts and materials they are using and are able to communicate them effectively.\n Use of an appropriate academic style throughout, with the terminology of psychological research methods accurately and confidently applied. Psychological terminology consistently used in a manner that indicates understanding of theories and concepts. Considered evaluation of evidence and findings from empirical studies and their related theories, in terms of culture, ethics, gender and methodology. This evaluation informs students’ interpretation of the research question, contributing to perceptive commentary.  If the topic or research question is deemed inappropriate for the subject in which the essay is registered, no more than four marks can be awarded for this criterion. This applies to psychology essays that are based on the collection of primary data.\nCriterion C: Critical thinking This criterion assesses the extent to which critical-thinking skills have been used to analyse and evaluate the research undertaken.\n   Level Descriptor of strands and indicators     0 The work does not reach a standard outlined by the descriptors below.   1–3  The research is limited.The research presented is limited and its application to support the argument is not clearly relevant to the research question.Analysis is limited.There is limited analysis.Where there are conclusions to individual points of analysis these are limited and not consistent with the evidence.Discussion/evaluation is limited.An argument is outlined but this is limited, incomplete, descriptive or narrative in nature.The construction of an argument is unclear and/or incoherent in structure hindering understanding.Where there is a final conclusion, it is limited and not consistent with the arguments/evidence presented.There is an attempt to evaluate the research, but this is superficial.If the topic or research question is deemed inappropriate for the subject in which the essay is registered no more than three marks can be awarded for this criterion.   4-6  The research is adequate.Some research presented is appropriate and its application to support the argument is partially relevant to the research question.Analysis is adequate.There is analysis but this is only partially relevant to the research question; the inclusion of irrelevant research detracts from the quality of the argument.Any conclusions to individual points of analysis are only partially supported by the evidence.Discussion/evaluation is adequate.An argument explains the research but the reasoning contains inconsistencies.The argument may lack clarity and coherence but this does not significantly hinder understanding.Where there is a final or summative conclusion, this is only partially consistent with the arguments/evidence presented.The research has been evaluated but not critically.   7-9  The research is good.The majority of the research is appropriate and its application to support the argument is clearly relevant to the research question.Analysis is good.The research is analysed in a way that is clearly relevant to the research question; the inclusion of less relevant research rarely detracts from the quality of the overall analysis.Conclusions to individual points of analysis are supported by the evidence but there are some minor inconsistencies.Discussion/evaluation is good.An effective reasoned argument is developed from the research, with a conclusion supported by the evidence presented.This reasoned argument is clearly structured and coherent and supported by a final or summative conclusion; minor inconsistencies may hinder the strength of the overall argument.The research has been evaluated, and this is partially critical.   10-12  The research is excellent. The research is appropriate to the research question and its application to support the argument is consistently relevant.Analysis is excellent.The research is analysed effectively and clearly focused on the research question; the inclusion of less relevant research does not significantly detract from the quality of the overall analysis.Conclusions to individual points of analysis are effectively supported by the evidence.Discussion/evaluation is excellent. An effective and focused reasoned argument is developed from the research with a conclusion reflective of the evidence presented.This reasoned argument is well structured and coherent; any minor inconsistencies do not hinder the strength of the overall argument or the final or summative conclusion. The research has been critically evaluated.    Criterion C: Psychology specifics guidance This criterion is looking for critical engagement with appropriate material. Students must show throughout the essay that they can analyse and evaluate the psychological theory and published research they have selected to answer the research question.\nResearch should be applied to effectively demonstrate the complex nature of a research question that connects with relevant areas of inquiry in the field of psychology. Throughout, students must use psychological theory and/or studies to justify points in the construction of their argument. They need to explain the material and explicitly link it to the research question. The research question should analyse and evaluate different perspectives or approaches to the research question. Their analysis must include:\n the context of the study or research (eg. a consideration of the nature of participants and materials used) an awareness of possible researcher bias and methodological biases.  It is the responsibility of the student to persuade the reader of the reasons for, and validity of, their perspective. Students should evaluate the evidence at the point at which they introduce it rather than in a separate add-on section. As in-depth treatment is required, essays that are largely descriptive or narrative in nature will not achieve highly against this criterion. Students are expected to draw conclusions throughout the presentation of their essay and in a summative conclusion at the end. This must be consistent with the argument and evidence presented in the body of the essay. The conclusion is not the place for new evidence. However, it should include unresolved questions that have arisen from the discussion and which could be suitable for further study.\nIf the topic or research question is deemed inappropriate for the subject in which the essay is registered, no more than three marks can be awarded for this criterion. This applies to psychology essays that are based on the collection of primary data.\nCriterion D: Presentation This criterion assesses the extent to which the presentation follows the standard format expected for academic writing and the extent to which this aids effective communication.\n   Level Descriptor of strands and indicators     0 The work does not reach a standard outlined by the descriptors below.   1–2  Presentation is acceptable. The structure of the essay is generally appropriate in terms of the expected conventions for the topic, argument and subject in which the essay is registered. Some layout considerations may be missing or applied incorrectly. Weaknesses in the structure and/or layout do not significantly impact the reading, understanding or evaluation of the extended essay.   3-4 Presentation is good. The structure of the essay clearly is appropriate in terms of the expected conventions for the topic, the argument and subject in which the essay is registered. Layout considerations are present and applied correctly. The structure and layout support the reading, understanding and evaluation of the extended essay.    Criterion D: Psychology specifics guidance This criterion relates to the extent to which the essay conforms to accepted academic standards in relation to how research papers should be presented. It also relates to how well these elements support the reading, understanding and evaluation of the essay.\nStudents may provide a section and subsection structure to their essays, with informative headings. Subheadings should not distract from the overall structure of the essay or argument presented.\nUse of charts, images and tables Any charts, images or tables from literature sources included in the essay must be carefully selected and labelled and referenced. They should only be used if they are directly relevant to the research question, contribute towards the understanding of the argument and are of a good graphic quality. Graphs or charts drawn from the analysed data should be selected to highlight only the most pertinent aspects related to the argument. Too many graphs, charts and tables will distract from the overall quality of the communication. Only summary data charts of information that is central to the argument of the essay should be included in the body of the essay. Tables should enhance a written explanation but should not themselves include significant bodies of text. If they do, then these words must be included in the word count. Students must take care in their use of appendices as examiners are not required to read them. All information with direct relevance to the analysis, discussion and evaluation of the essay must be contained in the main body of the essay. A bibliography is an essential structural element, contributing as far as it is visually presented, to criterion D, in addition to the other presentation requirements: title page, table of contents, page numbers, and so on. While there is no explicit penalty in criterion D for exceeding 4,000 words, students should be aware that examiners will not read beyond the 4,000-word limit, therefore affecting the application of multiple criteria. Criterion D specifically may be impacted if, in exceeding 4,000 words, one of the structural requirements of the essay (for example, the conclusion, or important illustrative material) is unassessed by the examiner because he or she is not required to read beyond 4,000 words.\nAny material that is not original must be carefully acknowledged, with specific attention paid to the acknowledgement and referencing of quotes and ideas. This acknowledgment and referencing is applicable to audiovisual material, text, graphs and data published in print and electronic sources. If the referencing does not meet the minimum standard as indicated in the guide (name of author, date of publication, title of source and page numbers, as applicable), and is not consistently applied, work will be considered as a case of possible academic misconduct. Incomplete references and those that do not meet the minimum requirements as detailed in the Effective citing and referencing document are not penalized in criterion D, but examiners are required to alert the IB to candidates who overlook these minimum requirements, for further investigation. Criterion D assesses references and bibliography purely on how they are presented (for example, consistent, laid out in an appropriate academic manner).\nCriterion E: Engagement This criterion assesses the student’s engagement with their research focus and the research process. It will be applied by the examiner at the end of the assessment of the essay, and is based solely on the candidate’s reflections as detailed on the RPPF, with the supervisory comments and extended essay itself as context. Only the first 500 words are assessable.\n   Level Descriptor of strands and indicators     0 The work does not reach a standard outlined by the descriptors below.   1–2 Engagement is limited. Reflections on decision-making and planning are mostly descriptive.These reflections communicate a limited degree of personal engagement with the research focus and/or research process.   3-4 Engagement is good. Reflections on decision-making and planning are analytical and include reference to conceptual understanding and skill development. These reflections communicate a moderate degree of personal engagement with the research focus and process of research, demonstrating some intellectual initiative.   5-6 Engagement is excellent. Reflections on decision-making and planning are evaluative and include reference to the student’s capacity to consider actions and ideas in response to challenges experienced in the research process. These reflections communicate a high degree of intellectual and personal engagement with the research focus and process of research, demonstrating authenticity, intellectual initiative and/or creative approach in the student voice.    Criterion E: Psychology specifics guidance This criterion assesses the student’s engagement with their research focus and the research process. It will be applied by the examiner at the end of the assessment of the essay, and is based solely on the candidate’s reflections as detailed on the RPPF, with the supervisory comments and extended essay itself as context.\nStudents are expected to provide reflections on the decision-making and planning process undertaken in completing the essay. Students must demonstrate how they arrived at a topic as well as the methods and approach used. This criterion assesses the extent to which a student has evidenced the rationale for decisions made throughout the planning process and the skills and understandings developed.\nFor example, students may reflect on:\n the approach and strategies they chose, and their relative success the Approaches to learning skills they have developed and their effect on the student as a learner how their conceptual understandings have developed or changed as a result of their research challenges they faced in their research and how they overcame these questions that emerged as a result of their research what they would do differently if they were to undertake the research again.  Effective reflection highlights the journey the student has engaged in through the EE process. Students must show evidence of critical and reflective thinking that goes beyond simply describing the procedures that have been followed. The reflections must provide the examiner with an insight into student thinking, creativity and originality within the research process. The student voice must be clearly present and demonstrate the learning that has taken place.\nExamples "

	"content": " This activity is a good introduction to a scientific inquiry as well as discussion in the psychology vs parapsychology introduction. The Forer effect refers to the tendency of people to rate sets of statements as highly accurate for them personally even though the statements could apply to many people.\nGoal Show students the importance of specific vs vague statements, demonstrate why horoscopes and psychics work and why people tend to believe in these seemingly random encounters. Introduce research in psychology testing and creation of psychological assessment.\nStructure Give students a questionaire to fill. The questionnaire should be irrelevant to the personality profile but still seem to be psychological - similarly to zodiac signs.\nExamples of questions are: - How often do you eat chicken meat? - How often do you follow weather forecast? - Which geometric shape you like the best? - What is your favorite colour?\nAfter students have filled in the questionnaire, create their personality profiles. The more \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; they look, the bigger the effect - tehoretically :) Each one is the same with the same Barnum statements. Stress out that they should not share it at this moment with their peers.\nHave them \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; each statement as \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, or neither. And then let them mark the final profile.\nAfter they return the profile, start a discussion\nAfter they hand you in their results, you can do the Which desert are you activity (in files). And then followup with the discussion.\n Statements  You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others\u0026rsquo; statements without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life.  Discussion Before the discussion, give students the option to \u0026ldquo;guess\u0026rdquo; what this activity tried to accomplish. Then tell them about the statemtns and that everybody got the same thing. Discussion topics\n Why did you / didn\u0026rsquo;t you think it described you well? Which statements do you think everybody agreed with? What is the \u0026ldquo;danger\u0026rdquo; of this process? How it can relate to psychology and \u0026ldquo;endanger\u0026rdquo; it? What is the important message to take away?  Follow up It is a good idea to analyse their results and potentially pinpoint those questions in which most people answered true/false.\n  Attachments   profile-result.pdf  (32 ko)   vague-statements-activity.PDF  (97 ko)   which-desert-are-you.pdf  (57 ko)    "

	"content": " Interesting Bits of Psychological science I started this website to store all activities that I use during my lessons as well as to provide activities to teach IB Psychology - Free of charge. IB is cool and I believe it\u0026rsquo;s goals are noble, yet the lack of support for their curriculum and charging people for everything, only providing licenses to those who pay etc. etc. goes against anything I believe open science and open education is. So this website allows you to have an alternative to paid resources and to provide guides for those who wanna teach or learn but don\u0026rsquo;t want to or can\u0026rsquo;t burn hundreds of dollars.\nWho is doing this? I am teaching psychology at NOVÝ PORG in Prague, but only as a side job. I am a scientist at National Institute of Mental Health and Czech Academy of Sciences, focusing on VR, technologies and their psychological, behavioural and neural correlates. I have a bit of experience with teaching (IB) Psychology for few years, and I have experience with studying psychology and neurosciences from both Prague, Canada (McGill University) and the US (University of California, Davis).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t consider what I write here as a necessary way to progress through the curriculum, but as a guideline that suits me and mine scientific background. You might find that I list things that IB either doesn\u0026rsquo;t do at all or isn\u0026rsquo;t keen on, but that is just my approach as a person, who has been doing psychology and psychological science for the past 10 years.\nHelping things grow If you have activities or you have suggestions to this website, please email me or better, follow instructions here.\nIf somebody wanna help with design or maintenance, I\u0026rsquo;d appreciate it as well.\n"

To learn t-test in excel, R or python. Studnets also learn the limitatios of some tests - having test with 3 right answers will not give enough variation ot assess what you want to assess.\nStructure Students in pairs switch in reading tongue twisters and in measuring the time. Each tongue twister should be read at least three times, better to be read 5 times by each students. Number of mistakes is recorded as well as time.\n Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

	"content": " Personality profiles derived from star placements during the time of one\u0026rsquo;s birth are a thorn in a foot of many psychologists. But is there a reason?\nOne of the old principles say, that if a theory survives for a long time, there must be some validity in it. So how is it with zodiac signs?\nThis activity can be preceded by the Forer effect activity\n Goal Investigate validity of zodiac personality profiles. Students learn how to operationalize and structure their investigation. How to actually \u0026ldquo;define\u0026rdquo; the zodiac signs, how to assess the correct approach, how to analyse collected data.\nStudents learn that such approach isn\u0026rsquo;t different from other psychological tests. In the end, we discuss why zodiac signs might have survived such a long time.\nStructure Students in groups are asked to \u0026ldquo;Validate zodiac sign personality types\u0026rdquo;. The first step will be to actually define those traits. After definitions are established, they are asked to devise a plan to actually test it. Several approaches are viable - either testing for traits and then devising zodiac sign from those (but that is not how it actually works and it is not what we want to test!!!). So the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; approach is to be able to append correct personality type to a correct zodiac sign - therefore person born as Leo, should be classified as such.\nAfter the method is determined, start collecting data. Note the importance of \u0026ldquo;blind\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;double blind\u0026rdquo; study in this case. Also talk about importnace of big samples.\nAfter the data is collected, students can provide it to the teacher who will analyse it appropriately (probably chi-squared tests or fisher exact test). Talk again about the importance of large samples.\nYou can even try and debate meta analysis - combining results from few different groups.\nFinish with the discussion about the results.\n Why did you obtain these results? Do you think your results invalidate the thousands years of knowledge? Why this theory \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo; for a long time.  Schedule  Define zodiac types - with the use of internet, books etc. Try to enforce multiple sources. Determine appropriate method to test if the sign \u0026ldquo;fits\u0026rdquo;. Collect the data. Talk about the importance of sampling and blind study. Analyse the results. Discuss the results and perserverance of invalid theories  Links Astrology\n"
