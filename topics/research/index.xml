      <description> What makes a good theory? It is a) testable b) leads to multiple testable hypotheses (not just one)

      <description>Measures of good science Research is not
Validity Types of validity
Reliability Unreliable test is always also not valid. Even seemingly &amp;ldquo;unreliable&amp;rdquo; results which are consistent with the prediction are considered reliable - e.g. tests for immediate stress levels are reliable when tested in the same conditions.
Types of reliability Test-retest
Inter-rater reliability
Research design Extraneous variables Demand characteristics
Blind and double blind study</description>

      <title>Sampling methods</title>
      <link>https://hejtmy.github.io/ib-psych/topics/research/sampling/</link>

      <description>Sampling is a process of selecting part of target population to be studied. In an optimal world, we would measure everybody. Measuring everybody would allow us to perfectly describe the population and get to something called &amp;ldquo;True mean&amp;rdquo;. If we get everybody&amp;rsquo;s height, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to run statistics. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; for group differences, we can be certain about our assertions regardless of statistics.
But we are not in an wishful and perfect world adn we only can measure a fixed amout of people - only a hundred inhabitants of France.</description>

      <title>Ethics in psychological research</title>
      <link>https://hejtmy.github.io/ib-psych/topics/research/ethics/</link>

      <guid>https://hejtmy.github.io/ib-psych/topics/research/ethics/</guid>
      <description>All research needs to abide any law in a country where it is conducted, but that is often not enough to make sure that participants are treated with dignity and respect. Until ethics in psychological research has been &amp;ldquo;established&amp;rdquo; and certain rules codified, researchers often conducted studies which might have had lasting implications on their participants without necessary precautions being made. For that reason, certain (legally still not forcable) rules were introduced and ethical review processes established.</description>
