      <description> Introductions Jean Piaget Sensorimotor stage There is a nice debate to what extent this is a human thing to have? Do animals possess object permanence understanding? There is a video of people hiding behind blankets, which shows the confusion of dogs to dissapearing humans. There is also a video of cats getting scared of their environment changing without their knowledge

      <description>Availability heuristic Let me illustrate this heuristic by the following conversation one of professors at UC Davis had with a friend of hers.
 I know there are no raccoons in Davis, but I saw one so they must be increasing in population.
No, there have always been racoons here.
There weren&amp;rsquo;t. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen one ever before and I live here 10 years.
I mean, I study that, so I know there have always been racoons here.</description>

      <description>Measures of good science Research is not
Validity Types of validity
Reliability Unreliable test is always also not valid. Even seemingly &amp;ldquo;unreliable&amp;rdquo; results which are consistent with the prediction are considered reliable - e.g. tests for immediate stress levels are reliable when tested in the same conditions.
Types of reliability Test-retest
Inter-rater reliability

      <guid>https://hejtmy.github.io/ib-psych/topics/research/sampling/</guid>
      <description>Sampling is a process of selecting part of target population to be studied. In an optimal world, we would measure everybody. Measuring everybody would allow us to perfectly describe the population and get to something called &amp;ldquo;True mean&amp;rdquo;. If we get everybody&amp;rsquo;s height, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to run statistics. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; for group differences, we can be certain about our assertions regardless of statistics.
But we are not in an wishful and perfect world adn we only can measure a fixed amout of people - only a hundred inhabitants of France.</description>

      <guid>https://hejtmy.github.io/ib-psych/topics/research/ethics/</guid>
      <description>All research needs to abide any law in a country where it is conducted, but that is often not enough to make sure that participants are treated with dignity and respect. Until ethics in psychological research has been &amp;ldquo;established&amp;rdquo; and certain rules codified, researchers often conducted studies which might have had lasting implications on their participants without necessary precautions being made. For that reason, certain (legally still not forcable) rules were introduced and ethical review processes established.</description>

      <description>Statistics allow us to determine laws in otherwise random world. Things happen with some level or randomness (error term in statistics). If you get A from a single math test and your friend gets a B, you would probably say it can be due to chance. But if you get an average of 85 points over 5 tests whereas your friend gets 77, you might start to think you are just better at Match.</description>

      <description>This activity shows that social change doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be directed by masses or majority, but few goal oriented individuals can shape the stream of river of human aimlessness. Students get an instruction to walk freely and follow others, with a small percentage of them getting clear instructions of what to do - walk towards a basketball court, walk towards a door.
Goal Students learn that if everybody is somewhat aimless and without a particular agenda, few individuals can actually instruct majority in accepting their views, if that is done subversly.</description>

The activity follows classes on research. Students are given each question immediately after appropriate lesson has been covered (e.g. question 10 after ethics have been gone through). In the end, students hand out a summary of a scientific paper.</description>

The Forer effect refers to the tendency of people to rate sets of statements as highly accurate for them personally even though the statements could apply to many people.
Goal Show students the importance of specific vs vague statements, demonstrate why horoscopes and psychics work and why people tend to believe in these seemingly random encounters.</description>

      <title>T Test Tongue Twisters</title>
      <link>https://hejtmy.github.io/ib-psych/activities/t-test-tongue-twisters/</link>

      <guid>https://hejtmy.github.io/ib-psych/activities/t-test-tongue-twisters/</guid>
      <description>Students read tongue twisters in pairs and then we test who is better in the pair using parametric and non parametric t-test.
Goal The goal is to see randomness in repeating the task even in one setting. To learn t-test in excel, R or python. Studnets also learn the limitatios of some tests - having test with 3 right answers will not give enough variation ot assess what you want to assess.</description>

      <description>Personality profiles derived from star placements during the time of one&amp;rsquo;s birth are a thorn in a foot of many psychologists. But is there a reason?
One of the old principles say, that if a theory survives for a long time, there must be some validity in it. So how is it with zodiac signs?
This activity can be preceded by the Forer effect activity
 Goal Investigate validity of zodiac personality profiles.</description>
