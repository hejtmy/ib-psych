Overview placeholder

## Goal
Studnets read the update of Alan Baddeley on his theory of working memory from 2004. This article is generally amazing, because it contents potentially all answers to any IB memory related question.

## Structure
Students read the article at home and answer these questions:

1. What was the original model proposed in 1974? 
2. What is central executive?
3. How does it differ from Atkinson and Shiffrin model?
4. What are some of the proofs that phonological loop exists as a theoretical concept.
5. Is visuospatial sketchpad good for serial recall?
6. What were the problems with the model it needed to change? 
7. Why is the prose recall problem for the original model?
8. Why was rehearsal thought to contradict the model?
9. What is the binding problem in neurosciences?
10. What is the episodic buffer? 
11. What problems with the previous model does the episodic buffer solve?
12. What problems remain with the new model?

potential answers
1. Just the regular model with VSS, PL and CE without EB.
2. Attention control element

### Schedule
1. Give students the article and at least a week to read it and answer all the question.
2. Go over the answers in the class with reflecting back on 
3. 
4. phonological similarity; Verbal supression; auditory supression; short words easier than long words; case studies
5. No. It can store oine pattern quite well, but not a series.
6. People with PL impaired still remember visually presented numbers quite well; artuculatory supression doens't have a devastating impact; proce recall is so much better;
7. Patients with short PL still can remember longer senteces
8. children reherse although they can't speak; rehearsal seems to work on VSS (ray figure)
9. 
10. System connected to LTM; not dependent on LTM; reflects on information; holds episodes during integration; modeling space; 
11. 
12. why isn't all memory EB?; separation from LTM; 

## Discussion
Reflect on other memory models you might have already studies or schema theory, top down processing etc.
