Students buy smarties boxes and then count how many of each colour is in each box. Then we do statistical tests to determine some level of 

## Goal
This activity trains students in sampling and statistics. Students should understand how to select an appropriate sample and how to conduct statistical analysis in excel or in other statistical software.

## Structure
Explain the goal of the research: To assess if the smarties come in 

Ask each resaerch group to buy 4 packs of smarties to assess the goal. Their sampling method should reflect the goal of the research.

After students come with smarties, have a discussion about their sampling methodology. Is there any bias? (Location, time - different batches of smarties might have different coloring)

Then have each group count colors in each box and put it in a table. Send the table to studnets and have them analyse it. This can follow explanation of statistical tests or prelude it. 

Try different versions - muted colors vs saturated colors. Base colors (RGB(Y)) vs other colors etc.

Have a discussion on what this exactly represents in psychological research (each smartie box is a person which has different levels of some traits).

### Schedule

## Discussion

1. How can bias be introduced in your sampling? How can it reflect results?
2. Is there a difference between having only 2 categories vs 10 color categories? How it changes statistics?
3. How can you connect this activity to real psychological research?
