+++

This activity is a good introduction to a scientific inquiry as well as discussion in the psychology vs parapsychology introduction. The Forer effect refers to the tendency of people to rate sets of statements as highly accurate for them personally even though the statements could apply to many people.

## Goal

Show students the importance of specific vs vague statements, demonstrate why horoscopes and psychics work and why people tend to believe in these seemingly random encounters. Introduce research in psychology testing and creation of psychological assessment.

## Structure
Give students a questionaire to fill. The questionnaire should be irrelevant to the personality profile but still seem to be psychological - similarly to zodiac signs.

Examples of questions are:
- How often do you eat chicken meat?
- How often do you follow weather forecast?
- Which geometric shape you like the best?
- What is your favorite colour?

After students have filled in the questionnaire, create their personality profiles. The more "official" they look, the bigger the effect - tehoretically :) Each one is the same with the same Barnum statements. Stress out that they should not share it at this moment with their peers. 

Have them "mark" each statement as "correct", "wrong", or neither. And then let them mark the final profile.

After they return the profile, start a discussion

After they hand you in their results, you can do the *Which desert are you* activity (in files). And then followup with the discussion.

### Statements

- You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.
- You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.
- You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage.
- While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.
- Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside.
- At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.
- You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.
- You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof.
- You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.
- At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved.
- Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.
- Security is one of your major goals in life.

## Discussion

Before the discussion, give students the option to "guess" what this activity tried to accomplish. Then tell them about the statemtns and that everybody got the same thing. 
Discussion topics

1. Why did you / didn't you think it described you well?
2. Which statements do you think everybody agreed with? 
3. What is the "danger" of this process? How it can relate to psychology and "endanger" it?
4. What is the important message to take away?

## Follow up
It is a good idea to analyse their results and potentially pinpoint those questions in which most people answered true/false.
