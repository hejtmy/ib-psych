Ask groups of students to investigate online dating. 

### Schedule

2. Ask each group to search for dating ads, preferably without pictures
3. Define clear goal: short hookups vs long term relationships?
4. Define good sampling - better to have data from multiple websites.
5. Each member searches for about 10 ads.
6. Do content analysis on those ads. 
7. Try to put results into some presentation/poster form.
