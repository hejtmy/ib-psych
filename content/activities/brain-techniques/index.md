Each table covers one method for investigating the brain.  You need to:

- Understand what the method involves
- Interpret data from the method to understand how it works and what it tells us
- Identify methodological and ethical issues with using it

**Comparing:**

- Level of structural detail
- Level of functional detail
- Ability to track change over time
- Ease of relating brain to behavioural data
- Practical issues (cost, portability etc.)
- Ethical issues (risk, discomfort etc.)


## Goal
