Students read tongue twisters in pairs and then we test who is better in the pair using parametric and non parametric t-test.  

## Goal
The goal is to see randomness in repeating the task even in one setting. To learn t-test in excel, R or python. Studnets also learn the limitatios of some tests - having test with 3 right answers will not give enough variation ot assess what you want to assess.

## Structure

Students in pairs switch in reading tongue twisters and in measuring the time. Each tongue twister should be read at least three times, better to be read 5 times by each students. Number of mistakes is recorded as well as time.

1. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked? 
2. How many cookies could a good cook cook If a good cook could cook cookies?
3. Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew. While these fleas flew, freezy breeze blew. Freezy breeze made these three trees freeze. Freezy trees made these trees' cheese freeze. That's what made these three free fleas sneeze.
4. Big black bugs bleed blue black blood but baby black bugs bleed blue blood.
