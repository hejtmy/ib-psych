Each groups of students presents a story of one cult. How it started, what it did and how it achieved its status.

## Goal
Learn closer about social identity theory, groupthink, social influence and other elements of social psychology

## Structure

- [Aum Shinrikyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo)
- [People's temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Temple)
- [Scientology]()
- [Rajneeshpuram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneeshpuram)

- Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple (peoples temple)
- Scientology and the Aftermath (scientology)
- A (Aum Shinrikyo) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyKA9xA6BD8

Each group should prepare a presentation that includes the following:

- Story of the cult - historical events
- Cult ideology - what the cult believes in and why?
- Cult leader - who was he
- Why people joined and remained?

*Cults and social psychology*:

- Attribution, conformity, compliance, influence
- Ingroup - outgroup mentality
- The cult and social identity theory

### Schedule
1. Separate students into groups 3-4 students each
2. Assign cult to each group

4. Tie in topics of social psychology with their cult studies
5. Students present

Dear class,

Brief summary regarding the Cult presentations. 

They will be due after the mocks at the end of May, beginning of June. I imagine it as a 20-40 minutes piece in a sort of a ‚Äústorytelling‚Äù fashion üòä Present the stories of people affected, build it in a sort of surprising way, use videos and audio recordings of its leaders, affected, practices and neatly fold in social psychology. 

I expect you to use internet, books, movies, documentaries, audio recordings/podcasts etc. There is so much to find. Please don‚Äôt limit yourself to only internet written resources and only wiki. You have a month.

Examples of where you can go for info is Haruki Murakami‚Äôs book on Aum Shinrikyo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_(Murakami_book)), podcast about scientology (http://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/) etc. Recommended documentaries available on Netflix/youtube etc.  (but there is so much more out there ‚Äì especially about scientology and peoples temple). Be mindful that not everybody needs to listen/watch all of it, but it might be an interesting study afternoon üòä. If you can‚Äôt get hold of some resources, please let me know.

Wild wild country (Rajneeshpuram) 
Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (scientology) 
Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple (peoples temple)
Scientology and the Aftermath (scientology) 
A (Aum Shinrikyo) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyKA9xA6BD8

I expect you to go over the following:

- Story of the cult - important historical events
- Cult ideology - what the cult believes in and why?
- Cult leader - who was he, what is his (it is always HIM üòä üòê) goal?
- How the cult ended and why?

And then tackle the following questions with the use of social psychology phenomena we‚Äôll talk about in lessons:

- Why people joined and remained?
- Why were they willing to do illegal and self-destructive stuff?
- If there were any ‚Äúsurvivors‚Äù, what made them leave?

Topics to focus on might include:

- Social identity theory
- Ingroup-outgroup mentality
- Compliance and influence techniques
- Etc. etc.

As always, hit me with questions if something is unclear. Looking for your presentations.
