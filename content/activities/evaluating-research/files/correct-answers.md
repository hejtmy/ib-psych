## Short-term retention of individual verbal items
Peterson, L. R., and M. J. Peterson. 1959. “Short-Term Retention of Individual Verbal Items.” Journal of Experimental Psychology 58 (September): 193–98.

1. Examine the course of retention after one brief presentation of a trigram (meaningless three-consonant syllables). Study difference in forgetting vs learning depending on number of repetitions.

2. the effects of verbal stimulation can decrease over intervals measured in seconds. It would  be predicted from such an interpretation that probability of recall at a given recall interval should increase as a function of repetitions of the stimulation. Forgetting should proceed at differential rates for items with differing numbers of repetitions.

3. short term memory indeed has a very limited duration and after 3  seconds 80% of the trigrams were recalled correctly, after 6 seconds it was less than 60% and after 18 seconds this dropped to less than 10%. 
- missing results of the second experiment

4. What did the authors say that can be a problem with their conclusion?
- Different types of learning can be at play. Only verbal memory tested. 

5. They were asked to recall triagrams after different periods of time ranging from 3-18 seconds marked with a red light appearing. In order to avert an individual’ rehearsal, subjects were asked to count backwards by steps of 3 from a randomly assigned three-digit number.

6. This method has proven itself to be good for this particular study. This was accomplished by creating a lab experiment with high control over its variables and nullification of confounding variables. The standardized method was replicated accurately allowing for sound results. The consistency and standardized approach allow for internally valid results

7. What other methods could authors use to study their theory? Describe at least one and compare it to the one they used.

8. The independent variable was the time difference of recall from first exposure to the
trigram. The dependent variable was the percentage of a correct recall 1-100 %. The delay of
recall was operationalized by waiting an amount of time in measured in seconds from a pool of
(3s, 6s, 9s, 12s, 15s 18s) before having the subjects recall the trigram. The dependent variable
was operationalized by having multiple test subjects and making a percentage of successful
recalls at each of the stages of seconds.
- missing the second experiment

9. Also, choosing 24 psychology
students from Indiana University makes it impossible to generalize to a wider society.

10. The research was internally valid due to the experiment taking place in a lab, the
variables being easily measurable and replicable. The research accounted to the confounding variable
of unwanted rehearsal of the trigrams before being asked to recall posing an inaccuracy of the
results. The subject was asked to count backwards by 3 from a randomly generated three-digit
number to combat this. 

11. The population was Cluster sampled. It consisted of students from the “introductory
psychology courses” at Indiana University. A disadvantage of this easy method of sourcing
subjects is that we cannot apply the findings of this research to a wider society

12. The sampling method was not chosen well. Though it allowed for a cheap experiment,
the lack of application to a wider society was the most concerning. If the researchers had used
random sampling, the outcome of the research could’ve been applied to everyday situations. I
assume cluster sampling was used because of the ease of collecting consent. The research paper
states that participating in experiments was a course requirement. This could mean that the
subjects didn’t consent to a particular experiment with knowing all of its details, but rather to a
group of non-predetermined experiments which would be conducted over the years of their
studies.

13. Was the research conducted ethically according to the principles laid out by the Belmont report? State why - what was done and what wasn't.

14. Does the research follow the APA code [link](http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/)?

15. Was there some potential danger regardless of the ethical requirements being supposedly met? How it could have been prevented or diminished?
