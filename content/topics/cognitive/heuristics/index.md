## Availability heuristic
Let me illustrate this heuristic by the following conversation one of professors at UC Davis had with a friend of hers.

> I know there are no raccoons in Davis, but I saw one so they must be increasing in population.

> No, there have always been racoons here.

> There weren't. I haven't seen one ever before and I live here 10 years.

> I mean, I study that, so I know there have always been racoons here. When did you see it? 

> I saw it at 2am when the baby woke me up and I went outside to chill for a bit.

> Ah, you have a baby?

> Yeah, she is a month old. 

> Congratulations. Racoon always there. Baby new.
