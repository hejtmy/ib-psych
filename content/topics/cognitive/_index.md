The cognitive approach to understanding behaviour looks at:

- cognitive processing (SL and HL)
- reliability of cognitive processes (SL and HL)
- emotion and cognition (SL and HL)
- cognitive processing in the digital world (HL only).

Relevant to all the topics are:

- the contribution of research methods used in the cognitive approach to understanding human behaviour
- ethical considerations in the investigation of the cognitive approach to understanding human behaviour.

The cognitive approach to behaviour views human beings as processors of information much in the same way as a computer processes information. The cognitive approach to behaviour focuses on areas of research such as schema processing, memory processing, and thinking, and how cognition may influence behaviour. Researchers are also interested in the extent to which cognitive processes are reliable, for example, in relation to thinking and memory. How cognitive processes may be affected in the modern digitalized world is an emerging field within the cognitive approach to behaviour.

Cognitive processes are often influenced in complex ways by emotions. The influence of emotions on cognitive processes is studied not only by cognitive psychologists, but is developing as an area of interest for cognitive neuroscientists as well as social psychologists.

Research methods in the cognitive approach to understanding of behaviour rely on experiments and brain imaging technologies as well as qualitative approaches to understanding everyday memory and thinking, making the cognitive approach an example of the holistic approach to understanding human behaviour.


## Cognitive processing

- **Models of memory**: The Multi-Store Model of Memory and The Working Memory Model provide a framework for an understanding of conceptualization of human memory processes over time. The working memory model is an elaboration of short-term memory, suggesting a number of components working together to process information.

- *Concepts related to memory processing*: Relevant concepts within the study of models of memory, for example explicit/implicit memory, sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, central executive, phonological loop, episodic buffer, visuospatial sketchpad.

- **Schema theory**: Cognitive schemas are seen as mental representations that organize our knowledge, beliefs and expectations. Multiple studies have indicated that schemas influence memory processes in encoding, storage and retrieval. Schema processing is to a large extent automatic and non-conscious which saves cognitive energy but at the same time could result in biases in thinking and memory processes.

- *Schema processing*: Relevant concepts related to studying schema processing could be but are not limited to: top down, bottom up processing, pattern recognition, the matching of a current input to information in memory,  effort after meaning—the attempt to match unfamiliar ideas into a familiar framework, stereotyping—an example of schema processing based on a fixed mental representation of a group of individuals.

- **Thinking and decision-making**: Thinking involves using information and doing something with it, for example, deciding something. Thinking and decision-making are thus closely related. Thinking is based on factors such as concepts, processes, and goals. Modern research into thinking and decision-making often refers to rational (controlled) and intuitive thinking (automatic). There is an increasing understanding of how emotions may influence thinking and the decision-making process because the consequences of decisions result in the experiencing of emotions and many of our choices are guided by the experience of or anticipation of such emotions.

- *Thinking and decision-making concepts*: Relevant concepts related to studying thinking and decision-making could be but are not limited to framing, heuristics, loss aversion, and appraisal.
- *Types of thinking*: There are two systems models of thinking: system 1—intuitive, automatic, quick and requiring limited effort, influenced by biases and system 2—rational, goal directed, requires intentional effort and time, analyses/controls for biases.
- *Models of thinking and decision-making*: theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behaviour (concerned with the relationship between attitudes and behaviour when making choices), the adapative decision-maker framework including emotions and goals in the decision processl, mindset theory arguing that thinking about one's ability is related to decisions of investment in performance

## Reliability of cognitive processes
- **Reconstructive memory**: Human memory is not an exact copy of events but rather a reconstruction that may be altered over time, through discussions with others or input from the media. Research shows that memory may be changed during storage, processing and  retrieval, for example, due to schema processing. Knowing this could be important not only in our daily lives but in particular in relation to eyewitness testimony.

- *Factors related to the study of reconstructive memory*: Relevant concepts related to studying the nature of reconstructive memory could be but are not limited to, confabulation( memory based on a fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted memory often believed to be true in spite of contradictory evidence), schema processing—memory (processing based on prior knowledge in the form of schemas which could result in distortion), false memories (recalling an event that never happened and believing it to be true).

- **Biases in thinking and decision-making**: Human beings are not always rational thinkers. Instead they rely on intuitive thinking and take cognitive shortcuts resulting in a number of well-researched biases. The tendency to focus on a limited amount of available information, to seek out information that confirms preexisting beliefs as well as the tendency to avoid the mental stress of holding inconsistent cognitions seem to be common sources of biases in thinking and decision-making.

- *Factors involved in biased thinking and decision-making*: Relevant concepts related to studying factors involved in biased thinking and decision-making could be but are not limited to rational versus intuitive thinking, heuristics, algorithms, anchoring, framing and representativeness as well as these cognitive biases: confirmation bias (the tendency to seek out information to confirm what you already believe), cognitive dissonance (a socalled motivational bias that focuses on personal motivation for selection and interpretation of information so that your cognitions are consistent with your decisions and/or behaviour), optimism bias (the tendency to think that nothing bad will ever happen to you), selective attention (the tendency to focus on a limited amount of stimuli when several are occurring at the same time), illusory correlations (the tendency to incorrectly identify correlations where there are none, as for example in “implicit personality theories”)

## Emotion and cognition 
- **The influence of emotion on cognitive processes**: Psychological and neuroscientific research has revealed that emotion and cognition are intertwined. Emotions are believed to perform an adaptive function in that they shape the experience of events and guide the individual in how to react to events, objects and situations with reference to personal relevance and well-being. Memories of emotional events sometimes have a persistence and vividness that other memories seem to lack but there is evidence that even highly emotional memories may fade over time.

- *Cognition and emotion*: Psychological and neuroscientific research indicates a relationship between cognition and emotion. Emotion influences our perception of the world and how we remember. Relevant concepts related to studying emotion and memory processes could be but are not limited to, flashbulb memories, theory of the emotional brain, the amygdala's influence on memory encoding,appraisal, state-dependent memory. Biases in thinking and decision-making can be studied using one or more examples.

- *The influence of emotion on cognitive processes*: The influence of emotion on cognitive processes can be studied using one or more examples.

## Cognitive processing in the digital world (HL)
- **Cognitive processing in the digital world**: For all three topics in the cognitive approach, and with reference to research studies, HL students should study the following. The influence of digital technology on cognitive processes and human interaction. The positive and negative effects of modern technology on cognitive processes. Methods used to study the interaction between digital technology and cognitive processes.
