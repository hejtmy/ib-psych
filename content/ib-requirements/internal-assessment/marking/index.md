## Introduction (6 marks)
Marks | Level descriptor
------| ----------------
0 | Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 | The aim of the investigation is stated but its relevance is not identified. The theory or model upon which the student’s investigation is based is identified but the description is incomplete or contains errors. Null and/or research hypotheses are stated, but do not correctly identify the Independent or Dependent Variables.
3–4 | The aim of the investigation is stated and its relevance is identified but not explained. The theory or model upon which the student’s investigation is based is described but the link to the student’s investigation is not explained. The Independent and Dependent Variables are correctly stated in the null or research hypotheses, but not operationalized.
5–6 | The aim of the investigation is stated and its relevance is explained. The theory or model upon which the student’s investigation is based is described and the link to the student’s investigation is explained. The Independent and Dependent Variables are stated and operationalized in the null or research hypotheses

## Exploration (4 marks)
Marks | Level descriptor
------| ----------------
0 |  Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 | The research design is described. The sampling technique is described. Characteristics of the participants are described. Controlled variables are described. The materials used are described.
3–4 | The research design is explained. The sampling technique is explained. The choice of participants is explained. Controlled variables are explained. The choice of materials is explained.

## Analysis (6 marks)
Marks | Level descriptor
------| ----------------
0 | Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 | Only descriptive or inferential statistics are applied. A correct graphing technique is chosen but the graph does not address the hypothesis. There is no clear statement of findings.
3–4 | Appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics are applied but there are errors. The graph addresses the hypothesis but contains errors. The statistical findings are stated but either not interpreted with regard to the data or not linked to the hypothesis
5–6 | Descriptive and inferential statistics are appropriately and accurately applied. The graph is correctly presented and addresses the hypothesis. The statistical findings are interpreted with regard to the data and linked to the hypothesis.

## Evaluation (6 marks)
Marks | Level descriptor
------| ----------------
0 |Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 | The findings of the investigation are described without reference to the background theory or model. Strengths and limitations of the design, sample or procedure are stated but are not directly relevant to the hypothesis. One or more modifications are stated.
3–4 | The findings of the student’s investigation are described with reference to the background theory or model. Strengths and limitations of the design, sample or procedure are stated and described and relevant to the investigation. Modifications are described but not explicitly linked to the limitations of the student’s investigation.
5–6 | The findings of the student’s investigation are discussed with reference to the background theory or model. Strengths and limitations of the design, sample and procedure are stated and explained and relevant to the investigation. Modifications are explicitly linked to the limitations of the student’s investigation and fully justified.
