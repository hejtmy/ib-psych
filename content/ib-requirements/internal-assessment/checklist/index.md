**Checklist for IA report**

**You cannot submit your IA report if:**

-   Your word count is not between 1800-2200 words
-   You didn't reference every idea that is not your own (-\> 0 points for the whole IA)
-   Your investigation is not done in experimental method with one independent variable that you were manipulating
-   The theory/model that you based your investigation didn't appear in peer-reviewed publication
-   You didn't use consistently one referencing format (eg. APA, Harvard...)

The following details should be stated in the header of the report

- Title of the investigation
- IB candidate code (alphanumeric, for example XYZ123)
- IB candidate code for all group members
- Date, month and year of submission
- Number of words

Report should consist of following components

- **Introduction** (Basically the Theory/Introduction section in peer-reviewed journals articles; must include operationalized IV and DV in null and alternative hypothesis)
- **Exploration** (Basically the Method section in standard peer-reviewed journals articles; must include research design, sampling techniques, participants, materials, controlled variables)
- **Analysis** (Basically the Results section in peer-reviewed journals articles, must include descriptive and inferential statistics, graph)
- **Evaluation** (Basically the Discussion section in peer-reviewed journals articles)
- References (don't count towards the word count)
- Appendices

Appendices should include 
(note: they do not count towards the word count but should be kept to a minimum)

- raw data tables
- print-outs of calculations and/or results from statistics software **or** calculations made for analytical purposes 
- consent form pro forma (unfilled)
- copy of standardized instructions and debriefing notes
- supplementary materials.

### Ethics
- Ethical guidelines should be adhered to throughout the planning, conducting and reporting of the experimental work for internal assessment (otherwise 0 points for IA will be awarded)

**Introduction**

Main assessment criteria markbands

(note: if one of the main criteria is not present at all - missing, 0
points will be rewarded for whole section)

|| Very good (5-6) |	Good (3-4) | Average (1-2) | Missing (0) |
----|----|-----|----|----|
Aim of investigation is stated|||||
Relevance for investigation is explained |||(only identified)|
Theory or model upon which the investigation is based is described|||(only identified)(contains errors)(is incomplete)||
Link of theory/model to student’s investigation is explained||||
Independent and dependent variables are stated||||
Independent and dependent variables are operationalized in the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis |||(IV and DV stated, not correctly operationalized)||


Guiding criteria for Introduction assessment

||Yes|	Not sure | No
----|----|-----|----
Have you explained why is this topic relevant to study?|
Do you have enough details for the theory/model you are describing?|
Do you have appropriate number of resources for the theory/model that you are describing?|
Are your resources from peer-reviewed journals?|
Have you searched scientific databases for the recent research articles connected to your topic?|
Is every information properly referenced?	|
Are all important terms defined? |
Is your investigation clearly connected to the described theory?
Is the aim of your study clear? (even for your grandmother?)	|
Have you stated whether alternative hypothesis is one-tailed or two-tailed?	|
Are null and alternative hypotheses clearly stated and are they clearly connected to the aim of the investigation?|
Is independent (IV) and dependent variable (DV) operationalized? |
Do you have only one IV and one DV?	|
