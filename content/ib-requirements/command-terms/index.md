Students should be familiar with the following key terms and phrases used in examination questions, which are to be understood as described below. Although these terms will be used frequently in examination questions, other terms may be used to direct students to present an argument in a specific way. The command terms used in psychology are arranged into four groups labelled assessment objectives (AO). The first three, AO1, AO2 and AO3, are hierarchical with more challenging verbs for assessment as you progress from AO1 to AO3. AO4 is not hierarchical, but represents actions related to subject-specific tasks.
