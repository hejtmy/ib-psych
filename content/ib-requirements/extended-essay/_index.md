The extended essay (EE) is an in-depth study of a focused topic chosen from the list of available Diploma Programme subjects. Word limit of the essay is 4000 words. Final possible grade is A-E (E is the failing condition, student will not get the diploma in that case).

Aim of extended essay:

1. Investigate in depth a topic of your choice within the subject
2. Develop your skills in research, analysis and evaluation, and communication

## Choice of topic in Psychology EE

Psychology may be defined as “the study of behaviour”. The subject involves studying the behaviours of humans and non-human animals and has a range of specialist terms, methods and literature. It is therefore essential for students undertaking an EE in psychology to:

- have a sound understanding of the subject and its methodologies
- choose a topic amenable to psychological investigation and analysis.

EE must be based on secondary sources only (the collection of primary data is not permitted for the psychology EE) and these must be peer-reviewed. Therefore "pop-psychology" kind of topic are not suitable.
Title of EE must be formed from the specified topic and research question (in form of the question).
Usual process of choosing the research question:

1. Choose a field in psychology of your particular interest
2. Refine this choice to a specific topic
3. develop a research question on this topic.

For example, a student might be interested in stress. They may then narrow this to the topic of stress within commercial aviation. Many large commercial airlines employ psychologists to investigate pilot performance and factors such as stress or emergency management. The student’s research question could be: “To what extent does airline pilot stress affect airline safety standards?”
The research question should require the construction of a systematically structured and fully supported argument in the development of an informed conclusion. Students must ensure that enough relevant and appropriate resources are available for them to conduct their research. They should investigate this at the start of their planning process.

## Treatment of topic in Psychology EE

### Primary versus secondary data
Primary data collected using the students’ own experiments, surveys, observations and case studies is inappropriate for the EE.
Instead, students must use secondary data from published sources. They should develop their argument with careful and appropriate citation of relevant concepts, theories and studies from academic psychological research journals and books.
Students should not make any assertions unsupported by evidence drawn from psychological theories or studies.

###  Analysis and discussion and evaluation
To develop a well-rounded understanding of their topic, students should carefully evaluate any research they cite. The essay should offer a balanced argument in response to the research question.
Students should demonstrate critical awareness and understanding of the material they use. They should analyse rather than simply describe. They need to apply what they have read to the research question rather than report the information.
One of the aims of all group 3 subjects is to enable the students to recognize that the content and methodologies of the subjects in group 3 are wide ranging and require students to critically evaluate the choices they make with regard to methodologies. An EE in psychology should demonstrate such understanding.
The Psychology guide introduces a framework for evaluation. It trains students to address cultural, ethical, gender and methodological considerations potentially affecting how a particular study or theory interprets behaviour.
Comparative analysis may also be a useful evaluative strategy.
Students should keep these considerations in mind when selecting a topic, generating a research question and developing their argument.

###  Ethical guidelines
The IB has published a set of ethical guidelines that apply to the psychology EE and internal assessment task. Many topics within psychology are sensitive in nature. Students should consider carefully all possible ethical issues before they embark on their essay. Students and supervisors share the responsibility for ensuring it does not breach the guidelines.

### An important note on “double-dipping”
Students must ensure that their EE does not duplicate other work they are submitting for the Diploma Programme. In particular, an EE in psychology is not an extension of the internal assessment (IA) task. Students must ensure that they understand the differences between the two. Students and supervisors share the responsibility for ensuring the EE differs in intent, content, methodology and outcome from the IA.

Supervisors play an important role in guiding students on these distinctions. Students risk their diploma if academic misconduct is detected.An important note on “double-dipping”. Students must ensure that their EE does not duplicate other work they are submitting for the Diploma Programme.
