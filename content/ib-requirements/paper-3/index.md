Markband | Level descriptor
-----|------
0 | The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–3 | The question is misunderstood and the central issue is not identified correctly, resulting in a mostly irrelevant argument. The response contains mostly inaccurate references to the approaches to research or these are irrelevant to the question. The reference to the stimulus material relies heavily on direct quotations from the text.
4–6 | The question is understood, but only partially answered resulting in an argument of limited scope. The response contains mostly accurate references to approaches to research which are linked explicitly to the question. The response makes appropriate but limited use of the stimulus material.
7–9 |The question is understood and answered in a focused and effective manner with an accurate argument that addresses the requirements of the question.
The response contains accurate references to approaches to research with regard to the question, describing their strengths and limitations. The response makes effective use of the stimulus material.
